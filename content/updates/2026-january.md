## First Full Month

My first complete month of tracking! The portfolio performed well despite some market volatility.

### What I Did This Month

- **DCA Strategy**: Added $1,500 to existing positions
- **Yield Optimization**: Moved stablecoins to higher-yield protocols
- **Rebalancing**: Slightly increased SOL allocation

### Performance Summary

The portfolio grew from $48,500 to $50,000, a **3.1% increase**. Most gains came from BTC and ETH price appreciation.

### DeFi Earnings

Earned $230 in DeFi income this month:
- Stablecoin lending: $150
- LP fees: $80

### Lessons Learned

1. Consistency beats timing - DCA is working
2. Gas fees matter - batch transactions when possible
3. Don't chase yield - security first

### Goals for February

1. Launch the Crypto Tracker app
2. Explore new L2 opportunities
3. Write more detailed DeFi guides

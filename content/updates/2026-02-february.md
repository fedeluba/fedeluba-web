## A month of shipping

February was all about shipping. After months of working on my DeFi automation project, I finally got the MVP out the door.

### The DeFi Automation MVP

The app I've been teasing is finally live! It's called **AutoYield** and it automatically rebalances your stablecoin positions across different protocols to maximize yield.

Key features:
- Monitors APY across 10+ protocols
- Auto-compounds rewards
- Gas-optimized transactions
- Simple one-click setup

Early feedback has been positive. A few users are already saving 2-3 hours per week on manual rebalancing.

### Portfolio Update

This month was solid:

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| New investments | +$2,200 |
| DeFi fees earned | +$385 |
| Gas spent | -$45 |

The stablecoin yields have been particularly good this month. Moved some positions to a new protocol offering 8% APY on USDC.

### Learning Solidity

Started diving into Solidity. My goal is to eventually build my own smart contracts instead of just integrating with existing ones.

Resources I'm using:
- [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io) - gamified learning
- Patrick Collins' YouTube course
- Reading popular protocol contracts on Etherscan

### Cat corner 🐱

Luna discovered she loves sitting on my keyboard while I code. Nova is jealous and now demands equal laptop time. Productivity has... adjusted.

### Goals for March

1. Get 50 users on AutoYield
2. Deploy my first smart contract to testnet
3. Hit $55k invested money milestone

*Keep building, keep stacking.*
